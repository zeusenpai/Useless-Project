### Project Description
A silly little project we made just for fun .pick a target(any one), and they‚Äôll get strange, funny, or totally random emails every 15 minutes or a fixed time gap for a whole day. It's our way of spreading a little harmless chaos and a lot of confusion!


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People just aren't getting enough weird emails these days. In a world flooded with important messages, where‚Äôs the chaos? Where‚Äôs the confusion? Where‚Äôs the what-the-heck-is-this in my inbox?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a prank site that sends bizarre, brain-rotting emails every 15 minutes for 24 hours straight‚Äîto whoever you choose. No purpose, no mercy, just pure nonsense for maximum inbox.
